Aftermath-Game
==============

Game written in C++ using SFML

Last Edited: September 22, 2014

I, Antonio Rivera, am the sole creator of this game (not including SFML or the free font LiberationSans-Regular. SFML was created by Laurent Gomila. SFML is available for free use under the following license: http://sfml-dev.org/license.php). It is currently a work-in-progress, and my purpose in making the game has been to improve my programming skills and to learn C++ and SFML. No warranty of any kind is offered for this game; it is provided as-is. I currently have not implemented a menu or "game over" screen of any kind. Once you die in the game (your health is the number in the upper-left corner), the application simply stops updating and you should close the window at that point. To start the game, run "Aftermath.exe". Note that the image files used in the game must remain in the same folder as the executable file (same with the .dll files from SFML). Also, the game begins automatically after loading is complete. If you notice missing textures, the image files are likely missing from the folder containing the executable file.
