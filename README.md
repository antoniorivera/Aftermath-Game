Aftermath-Game
==============

Game written in C++ using SFML

I, Antonio Rivera, am the sole author of this game. It is currently a work-in-progress, and my purpose in making the game 
has been to improve my programming skills and to learn C++ and SFML. No warranty of any kind is offered for this game; if 
downloaded, it is to be used as-is. I currently have not implemented a menu or "game over" screen of any kind. Once you die 
in the game, the application simply stops updating and you should close the window at that point.
To start the game, run "First RPG" (an executable file). Note that the image files used in the game must remain in the same 
folder as the executable file (same with the .dll files from SFML). Also, the game begins automatically after loading is 
complete. If you notice missing textures, the image files are likely missing from the folder containing the executable file.
